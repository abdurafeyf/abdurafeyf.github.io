Hello there! I am completing my undergraduate degree in Software Engineering / Computer Science at the [NUST](https://nust.edu.pk) under the tutelage of [Dr. Hashir Kiani](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk/faculty/hashir-moheed-kiani/), [Dr. Bilal Ali](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk/faculty/hafiz-syed-muhammad-bilal-ali/), and [Prof. Nazia Perwaiz](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk/faculty/nazia-perwaiz/). My research interests include Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. My goal is to understand biases of NLP models, and leverage this understanding to build more efficient and controllable systems.

In Summer 2024, I worked as a Research Assistant at the SEARCH Lab, [University of Saskatchewan](https://usask.ca/), under the supervision of [Dr. Zadia Codabux](https://www.cs.usask.ca/faculty/zadiacodabux/research.html), conducting research on 'Reducing Technical Debt by Streamlining Issue Assignment on GitHub' under the AI4SE umbrella.

During my junior year, I spent a semester at [Utah Tech University](https://utahtech.edu/), studying Machine Learning and Distributed Computing. The whole semester was funded by the U.S. Department of State in partnership with [IREX](https://www.irex.org/).
